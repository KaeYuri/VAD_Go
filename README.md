# Knowledge

type Info struct {
	Frames     int64
	// An audio frame, or sample, contains amplitude (loudness) information at that particular point in time.
	// To produce sound, tens of thousands of frames are played in sequence to produce frequencies.
	
	Samplerate int32
	// Number of samples of audio carried per second, measured in Hz or kHz (one kHz being 1 000 Hz).
	// For example, 44 100 samples per second can be expressed as either 44 100 Hz, or 44.1 kHz.
	
	Channels   int32
	// An audio channel or audio track is a audio signal communications channel in a storage device,
	// used in operations such as multi-track recording and sound reinforcement.
	// In stereo they are twho channels : Left and Right
	
	Format     Format
	Sections   int32
	
	Seekable   int32
	// Buffered zone that you can pick ?
